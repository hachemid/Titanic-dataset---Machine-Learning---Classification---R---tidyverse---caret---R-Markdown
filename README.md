# Titanic-dataset---Machine-Learning---Classification---R---tidyverse---caret---R-Markdown

The aim of the project is use the Titanic passenger data such as age, gender, class ... to build an optimal Machine Learning model using R programming language to predict whether a person will survive or not.

Imporitng data using the titanic library in R.
Exploratory Data Analysis using dplyr and ggplot2.
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest-Neighbors, Decision trees, Random Forest, Naive-Bayes.
Use Confusion Matrix and Accuracy as evaluation metrics.
caret library is used for resampling and model training.
rsample library is used for resampling procedures.
